Basic RPN calculator made for the sole purpose of brushing up my problem solving skills. Makefile is provided for linux platforms.

	1) Type "make" in the program directory to compile with gcc.
	2) Execute using ./rpn
	3) Type "make clean" to clean the project directory.
	
The calculator only supports +,-,/,* operations for now. 
type a value or an operator and press enter to add to the stack.
type "clear" to clear the stack.
type "exit" to exit the program.
